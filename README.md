Data-Analytics-Dashboard-RealTime-Insights
Introduction:
To ensure effective collaboration and maintain a structured record of all project artefacts, the team adopted Git and GitHub as the primary configuration management and version control tools throughout the development of the Data Analytics Dashboard for Real-Time Business Insights. 

A private GitHub repository was created and shared among the three team members. Each member cloned the repository to their local environment and contributed regularly through commits, pushes, and pull requests. This ensured that all project files—including the project charter, workflow analysis, Gantt chart, risk management plan, literature review, and dashboard design documents—were stored in a centralised and version-controlled environment. 

Branches were used to manage different components of the project. For example, separate branches were created for the literature review, dashboard workflow analysis, and risk assessment sections. These branches were merged into the main branch only after review and approval, reducing conflicts and maintaining document integrity. Each commit was made with descriptive messages such as “Updated workflow diagram,” “Added risk mitigation strategies,” or “Revised project scope,” ensuring transparency and traceability. 

GitHub also allowed the team to efficiently coordinate responsibilities
